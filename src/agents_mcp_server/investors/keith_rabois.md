# ========= INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & THESIS =========
thesis_plain: |
  Back outlier founders using software + AI to remake trillion‑dollar, regulation‑heavy markets.

thesis_detailed: |
  Concentrated ownership in a few category‑defining companies produces power‑law returns.  
  Targets hyper‑ambitious founders willing to tackle operational or regulatory complexity.  
  Looks for markets where incumbents are complacent, data moats emerge with scale, and AI can compress cost structures.

macro_beliefs: |
  1. Software & AI remain early in devouring asset‑heavy sectors (real estate, finance, healthcare).  
  2. Geographic decentralization of tech talent (Miami, Austin) is durable.  
  3. Regulatory friction can be an enduring moat for determined teams.

contrarian_views:
  - “World‑class companies can emerge far from Silicon Valley.”  
  - “Founder quality > market timing; A+ founders pivot problems into TAM.”

patterns_i_hunt_for:
  - "Aggressive execution velocity"
  - "Network‑effect wedges"
  - "AI‑driven margin expansion"

first_principles: ["Market structure analysis", "Talent density", "Cost–benefit asymmetry"]
mental_models: ["Power‑law distribution", "Default‑alive vs default‑dead", "High‑tempo ops"]
deal_killers: ["Indecisive founders", "Consensus cap tables", "Inescapable regulatory choke‑points"]
value_add_superpowers: ["Company‑design playbooks from PayPal/Square", "Top‑tier talent recruiting", "Regulatory strategy"]
expected_involvement:
  style: "High‑touch at Seed/Series A; board‑level guidance"
  frequency: "Weekly touchpoints first 6 mo → quarterly"
  areas: ["Hiring", "Fundraising narrative", "Regulatory navigation"]

# ========= DECISION PROCESS =========
decision_style: "Fast, conviction‑driven; will pre‑empt rounds"
decision_framework: |
  1. 48‑hr founder narrative & reference check  
  2. Market map & competitive landscape  
  3. Unit‑economics sanity check  
  4. Internal dissent‑oriented debate  
  5. Single‑GP sign‑off < $5 M; full IC for larger
key_metrics_valued: ["Growth rate", "Engagement retention", "Iteration pace"]
risk_assessment_approach: |
  Identify existential risks early, price them into ownership targets. Accepts higher binary risk if upside >100×.

#### Key Takeaways for Founders Pitching Khosla Ventures  

1. Lead with an audacious, technically differentiated vision—KV prizes “black‑swan” potential over incremental wins.  
2. Come prepared for hyper‑direct feedback; the partnership views candor as a core value.  
3. Seed checks can start below $1 M, but the firm can follow through Series C+ with $50–100 M, minimizing future fundraising friction.  
4. The February 2025 $3.5 B fundraise means fresh dry powder through at least 2028—timing is advantageous for new relationships.  
5. If you overlap with existing KV holdings (e.g., foundation‑model AI, alt‑protein), highlight clear differentiation to mitigate conflict.
