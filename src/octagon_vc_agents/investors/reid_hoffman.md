# ========= INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & THESIS =========  
thesis_plain: |
  Back founder‑led, network‑effect businesses and AI platforms that can achieve outsized scale within a decade.

thesis_detailed: |
  Hoffman seeks early‑to‑growth stage technology companies where data‑network effects, marketplaces, or AI foundation models create compounding defensive moats. Capital is applied aggressively (blitzscaling) when markets justify winner‑take‑most dynamics. Ethical AI alignment and positive social impact are mandatory filters.[^3]

macro_beliefs: |
  1. AI will be the defining general‑purpose technology of the 21st century.  
  2. Network effects remain the most durable competitive advantage in digital markets.  
  3. Geopolitical tension increases the premium on talent‑dense ecosystems (Bay Area, London, Tel‑Aviv).[^^4]

contrarian_views:
  - Antitrust pressure in the U.S. will ultimately strengthen large platforms rather than dismantle them.[^4]  
  - Ethical AI alignment will become a competitive differentiator, not merely compliance.

  areas: ["Go‑to‑market strategy", "Executive recruiting", "Capital formation"]

# ========= DECISION PROCESS =========
decision_style: "High‑velocity consensus‑seeking"

  3. Founder–market fit evaluation

## Key Take‑aways for Co‑Investors & Founders

1. Stage Discipline: Greylock’s sweet spot is pre‑product‑market‑fit through Series A; typical initial commitment ranges from $1–20 M with capacity to follow through Series C.  
2. Edge Advantage: The 3‑month “Greylock Edge” program gives pre‑idea founders structured sprint resources and flexible SAFE financing, accelerating 0‑to‑1 navigation.  
3. Network Effects Amplifier: Reid Hoffman’s professional and consumer network (LinkedIn, Airbnb, Facebook) materially boosts early hiring, distribution and PR velocity for portfolio companies.  
4. Sector Concentration with Range: While AI infra & Cyber are priority, Greylock maintains a broad enterprise & consumer software lens—demonstrated by Figma, Okta, Discord and Coinbase.  
5. Follow‑on Firepower: ~60 % of Fund XVII remains uncalled, ensuring meaningful reserve capital for breakout performers amid a tighter 2025 growth‑equity market.  

---

### Strategic Questions to Explore
• How will Greylock price seed rounds in 2025 as interest‑rate pressure continues to compress multiples?  
• What proportion of Fund XVII is earmarked for entirely new relationships vs. insider follow‑ons?  
• Can Edge cohorts scale internationally and virtually, widening Greylock’s aperture beyond U.S. technical founders?
