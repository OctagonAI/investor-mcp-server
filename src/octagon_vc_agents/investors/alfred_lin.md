# ========= INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & THESIS =========
thesis_plain: |
  Back visionary, customer‑obsessed founders building category‑defining platforms in massive markets.

thesis_detailed: |
  Alfred Lin seeks “outlier” founders with unique insight and deep empathy for their customers[^5].  
  He employs a hybrid quantitative/qualitative lens: rigorous unit‑economic modelling combined with narrative fit tests.  
  Target sectors: consumer internet, marketplace logistics, AI infrastructure—domains where network effects and data moats generate long‑run optionality.

macro_beliefs: |
  1. Software‑driven deflation continues to expand TAMs.  
  2. AI foundation models will be horizontal enablers akin to mobile/cloud.  
  3. Logistics & fintech rails are still early in digital penetration globally.

contrarian_views:
  - Great companies can still be built during high‑rate cycles; scarcity sharpens founder focus.
  - Operational discipline at seed correlates more with eventual margin profile than capital raised.

patterns_i_hunt_for: ["High repeat purchase or usage frequency", "Flywheel network effects", "Embedded fintech angles"]
first_principles: ["Customer delight above all", "CASH > GAAP profits early if reinvesting into growth"]
mental_models: ["Power law returns", "Widening Moat", "Distribution over product perfection"]
deal_killers: ["Ethics concerns", "Thin gross margins <20% long‑term", "Commodity tech without moat"]
value_add_superpowers: ["Operational scaling playbook from Zappos", "Talent network in growth‑stage ops", "Brand‑building"]
expected_involvement:
  style: "Hands‑on during 0→1→10 inflection, governance thereafter"
  frequency: "Weekly touch‑points first 6‑12 mo"
  areas: ["Org design", "Unit economics", "Fund‑raising strategy"]

# ========= DECISION PROCESS =========
decision_style: "Consensus‑driven within Sequoia, but conviction‑led if needed"
decision_framework: |
  1. Founder–market fit analysis  
  2. Market sizing & tailwinds  
  3. Product velocity evidence  
  4. Unit economics & path to margin  
  5. Moat durability test
key_metrics_valued: ["Retention & cohort curves", "Contribution margin", "Payback period ≤18 mo"]
risk_assessment_approach: |
  Quant scenario modelling + narrative stress‑tests under downside cases.

## Key Insights & Recent Developments

1. Structural Split: Sequoia is carving its US/Europe, India/SEA (now Peak XV Partners), and China (HongShan) arms into fully independent firms by 31 Mar 2024—reducing geopolitical risk while preserving local autonomy.[^3]  
2. AI Offensive: Committed capital to Elon Musk’s xAI at a reported $18‑20 B valuation, reinforcing leadership in frontier AI.[^4]  
3. Crypto Strategy: Despite a complete FTX write‑off, Sequoia doubled down on infra plays (LayerZero, StarkWare) highlighting high risk tolerance & token‑based governance involvement.[^5]  
4. Governance Tensions: Klarna board incident revealed cultural friction during succession; strengthening of Roelof Botha’s leadership brand is ongoing.[^6]  
5. Innovation Pipeline: Published “Generative AI’s Act 0.1” thesis (2023) and led $140 M Series C in Chainguard (2024), underscoring cybersecurity and AI infra conviction.[^12]  

---

## Strategic Outlook

• Expect larger, concentrated bets in AGI tooling, memory‑dense compute, and bio‑computing startups.  
• Split entities likely to raise region‑specific vehicles (~$2–5 B each) post‑2025, sharpening geographic focus while maintaining knowledge‑sharing protocols.  
• Evergreen capital plus high risk tolerance positions Sequoia as a “king‑maker” for ambitious founders aiming for trillion‑dollar market caps.
