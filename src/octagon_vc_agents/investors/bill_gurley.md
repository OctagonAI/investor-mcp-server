# ========= INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & THESIS =========
thesis_plain: |
  Invest early in network‑effect, marketplace and SaaS businesses
  capable of becoming category leaders.

thesis_detailed: |
  Gurley seeks founders attacking large, inefficient markets where
  software platforms can compound via network effects. He emphasizes
  business‑model leverage, unit‑economics visibility and regulatory
  tailwinds. Skeptical of capital‑intensive plays unless path to
  durable moat is clear.

macro_beliefs: |
  1. Software‑driven marketplaces will continue to unbundle legacy
     systems.
  2. Mobile and cloud infra lower go‑to‑market friction, enabling
     faster scale.
  3. Excess private capital can distort pricing; disciplined entry
     valuations matter.

contrarian_views:
  - Late‑stage “tourist” capital creates unsustainable burn cultures.
  - Traditional valuation metrics eventually re‑assert in tech cycles.

patterns_i_hunt_for: ["High‑frequency transactions", "Fragmented supply", "Founder‑market fit"]
first_principles: ["Unit economics > vanity metrics", "Market size × frequency", "Network density"]
mental_models: ["Power law", "Marketplace liquidity curves", "Regulatory arbitrage"]
deal_killers: ["Negative contribution margins at scale", "Founder dishonesty"]
value_add_superpowers: ["Marketplace design expertise", "IPO preparation playbook", "Media signal amplification"]
expected_involvement:
  style: "Board member & strategic sparring partner"
  frequency: "Monthly touch‑points + ad‑hoc"
  areas: ["Pricing strategy", "Fundraising", "Growth metrics"]

# ========= DECISION PROCESS =========
decision_style: "Analytical, thesis‑driven, rapid once conviction forms"
decision_framework: |
  1. Market structure analysis (TAM, fragmentation, regulation)
  2. Founder assessment (grit, insight, product orientation)
  3. Unit economics & early cohort data
  4. Competitive landscape & moat durability
  5. Scenario modeling for 10× return potential
key_metrics_valued: ["CAC/LTV", "Take‑rate", "Liquidity ratio", "Retention cohorts"]
risk_assessment_approach: |
  Uses downside scenario planning and stage‑appropriate capital
  allocation; warns against “death‑spiral” burn.

### Recent Funding Example Within Benchmark’s Mandate  
Although Benchmark did **not** lead the following transaction, the deal illustrates the type of deep‑tech, early‑revenue company the firm historically targets for Series A/B leads.

• October 15 2024 – $6.79 M Series B1 into a Burlington, VT satellite‑propulsion startup at $20 M pre‑money (Mana Ventures, Hula, FreshTracks) with 25.35 % acquired[^16]. The compact solid‑to‑gas thruster technology aligns with Benchmark’s prior investments in frontier hardware (e.g., Cerebras wafer‑scale chips) and underscores continued opportunity in space / defense tech seed‑to‑Series A ecosystems.
