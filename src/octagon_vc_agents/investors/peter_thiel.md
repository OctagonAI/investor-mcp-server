# ========= INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & THESIS =========
thesis_plain: |
  Invest in companies that will become category‑defining monopolies by leveraging breakthrough technology and network effects.[^5]

thesis_detailed: |
  Thiel champions “going from 0 → 1”—backing founders with secrets about the future that enable creation of entirely new markets rather than incremental improvements. Preference for businesses with strong defensive moats (IP, data, network effects) capable of 10‑100× returns within a decade.[^5]

macro_beliefs: |
  Western society is experiencing technological stagnation; radical innovation—especially in AI, aerospace, biotech, and frontier hard‑tech—will unlock outsized economic and geopolitical value.[^5]

contrarian_views:
  - Peak globalization is behind us; focus will shift to resilient national production.[^5]
  - Higher education is over‑valued; talent can be unlocked earlier via entrepreneurial paths (Thiel Fellowship).[^1]
patterns_i_hunt_for: ["Founders solving non‑consensus, high‑impact problems", "Businesses with proprietary data loops", "Network‑driven monopolies"]
first_principles: ["Power‑law returns", "Secrets thesis", "Definite optimism"]
mental_models: ["0→1 vs. n→1", "Network effects", "Schumpeterian creative destruction"]
deal_killers: ["Pure commodity plays", "No path to durable moat", "Founders lacking contrarian insight"]
value_add_superpowers: ["Global network access", "Policy influence", "Fund‑raising signal", "Strategic counsel on defensibility"]
expected_involvement:
  style: "High‑conviction but low‑frequency"
  frequency: "Quarterly strategic sessions; ad‑hoc high‑stakes support"
  areas: ["Capital strategy", "Regulatory navigation", "Key hiring"]

# ========= DECISION PROCESS =========
decision_style: "Speedy single‑partner conviction; minimal consensus required"
decision_framework: |
  1. Assess secret/insight uniqueness  
  2. Evaluate monopoly potential  
  3. Estimate power‑law upside vs. existential risk  
  4. Decide within 7‑14 days
key_metrics_valued: ["Network growth rate", "Data accumulation rate", "Gross margin potential"]
risk_assessment_approach: |
  Accept high binary risk if tail potential >100×; downside limited strictly to invested capital.
time_to_decision_days: 10

### Portfolio Snapshot (select)  
• SpaceX – $180 B secondary valuation (Apr 2025) [^1]  
• Palantir – IPO 2020, $35 B market cap (Apr 2025) [^1]  
• Anduril – in talks for $28 B valuation, $1 B+ FF commitment (Feb 2025) [^4]  
• Crusoe Energy – $500 M Series C (Nov 2024), FF lead [^3]  
• Flexport, Stripe, Airbnb, Facebook/Meta, Spotify, Nubank, Wish, Neuralink, Twilio [^1]

Average gross MOIC on realised exits (publicly reported): 7.2× (Facebook, Airbnb, Spotify, Lyft) [^8]

---

### Recent Deal Flow & Signals  
1. Crusoe Energy | $500 M round | Accelerates AI‑optimised methane‑to‑compute thesis [^3]  
2. Anduril Series‑D+ | pending | Reinforces dual‑use defense/autonomy corridor [^4]  
3. HALEU nuclear fuel start‑up | Undisclosed Series B | Aligns with energy‑security macro theme [^5]  
4. Biofire | $14 M Series A | Consumer frontier tech meets public‑safety narrative [^5]  
5. Earable | $6.6 M Seed+ | Emerging neuro‑interface & sleep‑health bet [^5]  

Founders Fund continues high‑velocity deployment while many Tier 1 firms reduced activity by 30–40 % in 2024‑25 [^9].

---

### Forward‑Looking View  
• **Fund‑raising:** Growth Fund III (target $3 B) to close H2 2025; expect $100–500 M checks for breakout portfolio leaders.  
• **Sector Priorities 2025‑2027:**  
 – Autonomous defense & space (Anduril, SpaceX spinoffs)  
 – Energy transition & security (HALEU, fusion, methane capture)  
 – AI infrastructure & compute efficiency (Crusoe, GPU‑native clouds)  
 – Bio‑compute convergence (longevity, neurotech)  
 – Decentralised financial rails (crypto infra despite regulation)  
• **Macro Sensitivities:** Higher‑for‑longer rates compress valuations; FF historically accelerates deployment in downturns, aiming for vintage alpha.  
• **Exit Outlook:** IPO window reopening 2025‑26 favours SpaceX, Anduril, Stripe; potential multi‑decacorn realisations could lift DPI for FF IV‑VII vintages.

---

### Risks & Mitigations  
1. Regulatory overhang in defense, crypto, biotech → Hedge via strong DC network & policy engagement (Trae Stephens, Thiel Fellowship) [^4][^6]  
2. High concentration in frontier tech → Mitigated by diversified 200+ active positions and late‑stage Growth vehicles [^8]  
3. Talent bottleneck in AI & defense startups → Pipeline via Palantir, Anduril, SpaceX alumni networks; FF acts as talent magnet [^3][^4]

---

### Strategic Recommendations  
• **LPs** seeking non‑correlated alpha vs. SaaS‑heavy VC peers should evaluate a Growth III commitment; align liquidity expectations to 10‑year horizon.  
• **Co‑investors** can access deep‑tech pipeline by engaging during Growth III allocations or leading seed rounds alongside FF scouts.  
• **Founders** targeting Seed‑Series B in fundamental tech: articulate contrarian insight, mission scale, and technical moat; prepare for rapid, debate‑driven diligence (<3 weeks).
