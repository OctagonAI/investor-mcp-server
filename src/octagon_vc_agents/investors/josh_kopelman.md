# ========= INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & THESIS =========
thesis_plain: |
  Back exceptional founders at the moment of company inception and build an
  unfair advantage through community, platform services, and follow‑on capital.
thesis_detailed: |
  First Round leads or co‑leads seed rounds, securing 10‑15 % ownership with
  $1‑3 M checks[^3]. The fund’s platform (Dorm Room Fund, Angel Track, Founder
  Libraries) creates network effects that amplify deal‑flow and portfolio
  success. Thesis rests on three pillars: (1) people > product > market at
  seed, (2) community compounding, and (3) rapid iteration to product‑market
  fit.
macro_beliefs: |
  • Software continues to eat sector‑specific workflows.  
  • Talent decentralization benefits non‑coastal founders.  
  • Early‑stage remains under‑served by large multi‑stage funds.
contrarian_views:
  - "Seed funds must behave like product companies—building services, not just picking."
  - "Geography is no longer a gating factor; talent density can be created digitally."

# ========= DECISION PROCESS =========
decision_style: "Consensus of two‑partner champion model"
decision_framework: |

  2. Monday partner meeting debate  
  3. Market mapping & reference calls  
  4. Unanimous partnership sign‑off for leads
key_metrics_valued: ["Engagement Δ", "Retention Cohort L90", "Founder velocity"]
